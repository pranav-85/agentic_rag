Figure 4. Training on ImageNet . Thin curves denote training error, and bold curves denote validation error of the center crops. Left: plain networks of 18 and 34 layers. Right: ResNets of 18 and 34 layers. In this plot, the residual networks have no extra parameter compared to their plain counterparts.

|           |   plain |   ResNet |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| 18 layers |   27.94 |    27.88 |
| 34 layers |   28.54 |    25.03 |
